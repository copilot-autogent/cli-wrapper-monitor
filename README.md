# CLI Wrapper Monitor

Automated regression detection for Copilot CLI wrapper behavior. Tracks how changes to the scaffold layer — system prompt, tool definitions, and hooks — affect model behavior over time.

## Problem

When Copilot CLI behavior changes unexpectedly, it's difficult to isolate the cause:

- Did the **underlying model** change?
- Did the **CLI wrapper** (system prompt, tools, hooks) change?
- Or some combination of both?

The community has documented dozens of open issues about unexplained behavior regressions with no tooling to decompose these two sources of change. This project addresses the wrapper-layer side of that gap.

## Approach

Snapshot-based regression testing scoped to the **Copilot CLI/SDK wrapper layer only**. Run standardized experiments monthly, compare against a stored baseline, and generate a diff report when behavior changes.

This is **not** a benchmark or leaderboard. It's a regression detector.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Context Tax

Measures token overhead imposed by the wrapper before any user content:

- System prompt character count + estimated token count
- Tool definition payload size (per-tool and aggregate)
- Total registered tool count
- Estimated total overhead tokens per session

Context tax directly reduces the effective context window available for user work. A 10%+ increase in overhead tokens is flagged as a regression.

### 2. Security Posture

Tests refusal behavior across a standardized probe set:

| Category | Expected | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Safe** | Always allowed | List files, read package.json, debug TypeScript |
| **Borderline** | Varies by config | Delete all files, read SSH key |
| **Dangerous** | Always refused | Malware creation, credential exfiltration |

Tracking this over time reveals when hook or system prompt changes silently alter the security boundary.

## Metrics

| Metric | Experiment | Unit |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `systemPromptChars` | context-tax | chars |
| `systemPromptTokensEstimated` | context-tax | tokens |
| `toolDefinitionsChars` | context-tax | chars |
| `toolDefinitionsTokensEstimated` | context-tax | tokens |
| `toolCount` | context-tax | count |
| `totalOverheadTokensEstimated` | context-tax | tokens |
| `bootstrapTruncated` | context-tax | bool |
| `safeAllowedRate` | refusal-rate | fraction |
| `dangerousRefusedRate` | refusal-rate | fraction |
| `borderlineRefusedRate` | refusal-rate | fraction |

*Token estimates use the ÷4 heuristic (1 token ≈ 4 chars), appropriate for English prose and JSON.*

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all experiments (static analysis mode — no credentials needed)
npm run experiments

# Pass a system prompt file for accurate token counts
SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE=./my-prompt.txt npm run experiments

# Pass tool definitions JSON
TOOL_DEFS_FILE=./tools.json npm run experiments

# Generate a diff report comparing baseline to a new snapshot
npm run diff -- --baseline baselines/latest.json --current baselines/2026-05-27.json

# Generate a diff report and save to reports/
npm run diff -- --baseline baselines/latest.json --current baselines/2026-05-27.json --output reports/diff-2026-05-27.md

# Show trend table across all historical baselines
npm run trend

# Save trend report to file
npm run trend -- --output reports/trend-2026-05.md
```

> **Note**: The refusal-rate experiment requires a live SDK connection (`GITHUB_TOKEN`). This is a sprint 2 feature.

## Snapshot Format

Results are stored as JSON in `baselines/` following [schema.json](./baselines/schema.json).

Starting with the May 27 baseline, each bootstrap file entry includes a `contentHash` (MD5) to detect content rewrites that happen to preserve file length.

## Regression Thresholds

| Severity | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| ⚪ Info | < 5% change |
| 🟡 Warning | 5–10% change |
| 🔴 Regression | > 10% change |

## Published Reports

| Date | Report | Summary |

| 2026-05-04 | [Context Tax Baseline](./reports/context-tax-baseline-2026-05-04.md) | 12,956 tokens overhead (6.5% of 200k window) |
| 2026-05-20 | [Diff: May 4 → May 20](./reports/diff-2026-05-04-to-2026-05-20.md) | 🔴 +24% regression — 29 tools, bootstrap truncation detected |

**Blog coverage**:
- [The Hidden Cost of Instructions](https://copilot-autogent.github.io/ai-security-blog/blog/hidden-cost-of-instructions) — May baseline analysis
- [We Found a Regression in Our Own Agent](https://copilot-autogent.github.io/ai-security-blog/blog/we-found-a-regression-in-our-own-agent) — the bootstrap truncation story

## Methodology Notes

- **Monthly cadence** — not CI on every commit; wrapper changes are infrequent
- **Copilot CLI/SDK only** — no cross-CLI comparison (resource constraint)
- **Static + live modes** — context-tax works without credentials; refusal-rate needs a live session
- **Results in repo** — snapshots committed to `baselines/`, reports generated locally
- **Blog only on interesting findings** — this is not a vanity metric dashboard
- **Content hashes** — each bootstrap file entry includes MD5 hash to detect rewrites that preserve length
- **RN-005**: LLM SDK 0.20a2 introduces interleaved reasoning via `/v1/responses` — live-mode baselines should check for reasoning token overhead
